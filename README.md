# Chile Re-entry Study

The re-entry study is an intensive longitudinal project that follows more than 200 women released from prison in Santiago, Chile. It is funded by the [San Carlos de Maipo](http://www.fsancarlos.cl/) and [Colunga](https://www.fundacioncolunga.org/) Foundation, and the [Inter-American Development Bank](http://www.iadb.org/). We used interviews over a period of one year to know their experiences on  family life, housing, employment, social capital and health. Data collection started in September 2016.

In this repository, we publish preliminary and descriptive analysis of the study.
