    "In this report I describe response rates by wave. I follow these general criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The estimation by wave only uses cases far beyond the wave-specific observation window. For instance, for the wave 2-months, we only consider those women who have been in the study for 4 months.\n",
    "- We use the observed response rates to simulate the final response rate of the study, and the rate 0.70 for the last wave (one-year).\n",
    "- This estimation is based on the administrative records of the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Names of waves: baseline, week, two_months, six_months\n",
    "- Variables names: d means date, c means clean, and cd clean date\n",
    "- Deadline corresponds to th time threshold to compute a given response rate"
